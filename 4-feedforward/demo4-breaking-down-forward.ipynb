        "Neural networks process data through a sequence of transformations, but when you use `nn.Sequential`, those transformations happen invisibly. What if you could control exactly how your data flows—adding custom logic, branching paths, or conditional operations that `nn.Sequential` can't express?\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Overview**: Move from using `nn.Sequential` _(recommended by default)_ to subclassing `nn.Module` _(full control and flexibility)_. You'll learn to implement the `forward()` method yourself, understanding exactly how data flows through your network and why this unlocks the ability to build any architecture you can imagine.\n",
        "> \n",
        "> **Scenario**: You're supporting an HR team that uses a neural network to predict employee attrition risk. The model works with `nn.Sequential`, but the team wants to understand exactly how employee features transform into predictions, and they're considering architectural changes that `nn.Sequential` can't handle. By learning to implement the forward pass yourself, you'll gain the foundation to build any custom architecture.\n",
